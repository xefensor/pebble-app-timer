# Timer maintainer instructions

## Scope

Work on the existing stock-PebbleOS implementation; preserve accepted behaviour and public compatibility.
Read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, output locations and commit/release policy.
The accepted app UI is on main. Older candidates, QA records and source archives
remain frozen; history is not a second active specification.

## Important boundaries

Native state, verified banks, deadlines and Wakeups are authoritative. Preserve eight slots, saved repeat duration, acknowledgement and migration compatibility. A transport ACK is not a saved-state receipt. Paused sharing expires after five minutes without renewing its observation. Zero does not establish completion. Keep one AppMessage queue. Appearance keys are separate from timer/Glance keys; appearance never changes a timer. Back, critical warnings, safe Keep-first Delete and immediate owner operations remain available.

## Read only what the task needs

- Ownership, storage, source lifecycle, privacy or capabilities:
  [current maintenance contracts](docs/MAINTENANCE.md).
- Native layout, typography, icons or interactions: [current UI](docs/UI.md).
- Versioning, archives, tags, upload or deployment: [release boundary](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Work and verification

Respect research/review versus implementation scope. Preserve established user
choices; clarify materially different interpretations before changing direction.
Run relevant required checks. Tests alone do not judge visual quality. Keep
source/portable tests, packaged execution, native emulator and real-device
verification distinct. Use disposable development evidence; do not overwrite
historical proof or relabel it as fresh.

`npm test` runs portable source tests and workflow guards. `npm run build`
creates a disposable candidate; it must not replace frozen dist/release files.
Do not bump versions or create release archives for routine edits. Never push,
publish or deploy as an implicit part of testing. Keep instructions current;
put superseded decisions in [history](docs/history/maintainer-notes-before-rework.md).
